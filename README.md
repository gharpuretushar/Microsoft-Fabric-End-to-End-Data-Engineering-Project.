# Microsoft-Fabric-End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Project.
📘 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data engineering and analytics lifecycle implemented on Microsoft Fabric, leveraging the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) for scalable and governed data management.
It showcases how raw data can be ingested, transformed, modelled, and visualized through Fabric Data Pipelines, Lakehouses, and Power BI dashboards, providing a unified and modern data solution for analytics and business intelligence.

🏗️ Architecture & Workflow

The project follows a Lakehouse-based Medallion Architecture built within Microsoft Fabric, integrating Data Factory, Data Engineering, and Power BI experiences:

Bronze Layer (Raw Zone): Data ingestion from on-prem SQL and external sources using Fabric Data Pipelines.

Silver Layer (Clean Zone): Data transformation and standardization in Fabric Lakehouse using PySpark notebooks.

Gold Layer (Analytics Zone): Curated data models prepared for reporting through Fabric Warehouse and Power BI.

The end-to-end flow ensures data lineage, reusability, and governance across the Fabric ecosystem.
